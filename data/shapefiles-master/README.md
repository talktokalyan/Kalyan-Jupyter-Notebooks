# shapefiles

Use these files to make maps.

## Directory guide
The directories are grouped by the outer boundary of the files contained therein. For example, all of the files in the [`india`](https://github.com/HindustanTimesLabs/shapefiles/tree/master/india) directory will have India's borders as their outer boundary.

Each lowest-level directory contains shapefiles and a README describing the files' source and the delimitation in which they were created. (Many of these READMEs are empty or incomplete. You can help by contributing.)

## File types
You'll find a few different file types which can be used to make maps with different software.
- **.json** [GeoJSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoJSON).
- **.kml** [Keyhole Markup Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyhole_Markup_Language).
- **.zip** [Shapefiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapefile), including the zip file with all three necessary file formats &mdash; *.shp*, *.shx*, and *.dbf*. Sometimes also including *.cpg*, *.prj* and *.qpj*.

### Sources
This map was largely taken from the [KML file](http://psleci.nic.in/kml/GUJARAT-AC.zip) in the Election Commission's [polling station locations site](http://psleci.nic.in/). However, that file did not contain constituencies 160-167, from Surat city, and 45-56, from Ahmedabad city. Those additional constituencies were drawn in CartoDB and QGIS from these images: [[1]](http://www.mapsofindia.com/assemblypolls/gujarat/gujarat-assembly-result.jpg) [[2]](http://www.mapsofindia.com/parliamentaryconstituencies/gujarat/images/ahmedabad-west-parliamentary-map.jpg) [[3]](https://ceo.gujarat.gov.in/AC_details.aspx?dno=22). Finally, in QGIS, we redrew the 0 constituencies to match with the actual outer boundary of the state.

### Delimitation
The most recent delimitation of Gujarat assembly constituencies came from the 2002 Delimitation Commission. The boundaries were approved by President Pratibha Patil on 19 February, 2008, and were first used in the 2012 assembly election.

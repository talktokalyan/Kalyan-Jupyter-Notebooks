### Sources
- **uttarpradesh_district.ext** 75 districts (four were not included in the 2011 Census) scraped from [Shristi(GIS-UP)](http://gis.up.nic.in/srishti/election2017/). [View the scraper's repository](https://github.com/HindustanTimesLabs/up-shape-scrape).
- **uttarpradesh_district_2011.ext** 71 districts from the 2011 Census. Started with shapefile from [DataMeet](https://github.com/datameet/maps/tree/master/Survey-of-India-Index-Maps/Boundaries), then filtered only Uttar Pradesh districts using [mapshaper](http://mapshaper.org/).

### Delimitation
Some districts have been renamed since the 2011 Census was conducted.

### To-do

Determine if the updated shapes of Bahraich and Shravasti are correct, or if there was an error in the Shristi(GIS-UP) shapefiles.

![Bahraich-Shravasti error](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HindustanTimesLabs/shapefiles/master/state_ut/uttarpradesh/district/img/shristi_gis_up_bahraich_shravasti.png "Bahraich-Shravasti error")

On 25 August, 2017, I sent an email to the National Informatics Centre in Lucknow (support-up@nic.in):

>Greetings,
>
>I work for the Hindustan Times in New Delhi, India. I noticed what I believe is an error in the KML files of Uttar Pradesh districts on the Srishti(GIS-UP) map (http://gis.up.nic.in:8080/srishti/election2017/). Bahraich district seems to have subsumed a portion of Shravasti district to the east. I have attached a screenshot.

>Either Bahraich district actually grew since the 2011 Census, or your shapefiles are slightly incorrect. Please let me know what happened.
